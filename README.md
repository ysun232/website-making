# website-making

In this file, I am trying out different functions of HTML and CSS as to gather a small amount 
of websites that I found useful back when I used to play a lot of Tera Online (computer game).
I still come back and rely on it sometimes as a source for HTML.

I do not own any of the pictures used by the website, all credits go to their respective owners.
